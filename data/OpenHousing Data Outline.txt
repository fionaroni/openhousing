Outline
	A facsimile of a scientific method
		-Define a specific range of years and geography we want to look 
			-ex) The City of Oakland from 1990-2015 or The Counties of the Bay Area since the founding of Google
		-Formulate null hypotheses before exploring the data
			ex. there is no significant change in education levels within a tract over time
			ex. the demographics within this tract do not represent the overall demographics within Oakland
		-Three main categories of hypothesis 
			1) There is no change within the tract over time
			2) There is no significant differences between tracts during the same time
			3) There is no correlation between factors x and y
				-Could also be a multilinear model of what predicts an outcome
					ex) median income, education, and population density affect violent crime rates
		-When using samples, only use estimates with standard errors bounded between 0 and 30% of the true value
			(This is an obscure line that I'll explain later -Tim)
		-Report whether a test is statistically significant

	1) Housing Cost/Cost of Living
		-Rent/Housing prices (Zillow/Trulia/Zumper)
		-Median Income (ACS)

				-Counties
				-Cities
